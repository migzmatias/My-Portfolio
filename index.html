                            <p>This Task Management Application built using C# is a console-based system that allows users to create, 
                                assign, track, and verify tasks while storing data in an external CSV file. It records 
                                task details such as description, timestamps, assigned person, and status updates, 
                                ensuring efficient task monitoring. The application supports different task statuses 
                                (Open, Assigned, For Verification, For Revision, Closed) and includes a verification 
                                 to validate completed tasks. The system ensures data integrity and provides a user-
                                  way to manage and track tasks effectively.</p>

                            <p>This game was developed using WPF and C#. The goal is to convert as much binary numbers you can into decimal numbers under time pressure.
                                The game features a scoring system that tracks the player's progress, a leaderboard that records high scores, and an input system for 
                                entering player names. A leaderboard window sorts and displays top scores based on performance, time played, and difficulty selected
                                 making for a simple yet engaging gameplay experience.</p>

                            <p>This leads tracker application, developed using WPF and C#, is designed to help schools efficiently manage and track potential 
                                enrollees—individuals inquiring about the school who may or may not choose to enroll. It allows sales teams to capture, track, 
                                and follow up with leads, organize important documents, and ensure accurate data reporting, ultimately improving the enrollment process.
                                Organizing documents includes a way to use a camera device to capture an image of the document or a file upload function

                            <p>This proposal website was developed with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. It is a website that showcases skills related to web development
                                as it involves different features like jQuery animations such as parallax effects and flipcards as well as integration with a database 
                                using PHP. A section of the website is dedicated to customization for the user where they are able to select a color palette from a color picker
                                as well as a color theory that the website will take to change the overall theme of the entire website to fit the users taste. Overall, the website was
                                used to propose an Artificial Intelligence that aids teachers in tracking attendance of students using Computer Vision.

                            <p>This dashboard was created using Microsoft's PowerBI. It is an analysis on a dataset named "Sleep Health and Lifestyle" taken from the
                                website "Kaggle". It contains information on various health and lifestyle factors such as sleep duration, stress levels, physical activity, 
                                blood pressure, and more. This dataset was used to explore the correlations and trends in health metrics, aiming to identify actionable
                                insights. This analysis and visualization on the dataset “Sleep Health and Lifestyle” provides comprehensive insights into the relationships between the 
                                aforementioned health and lifestyle factors separated by demographic groups such as gender and age.
